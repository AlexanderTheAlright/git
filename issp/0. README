Welcome to my final write-up!

*** RQ ***
The basic motivation of my project is to investigate whether objective inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient),
left-leaning ideology, or perception that one is under-rewarded or over-rewarded better predicts perceptions
of inequality.

*** PROJECT PIECES ***
The project has five relevant components:
    1. pre-registration_research_protocol: A short write-up of my analysis plan, dataset, and hypotheses.
    2. issp_inequality_codebook: The code book for the data.
    3. final_paper: The final write-up.
    x. issp_analysis: The R code that used to conduct my analyses.
    xx. issp_inequality_2019: The STATA file of the 1999 ISSP module data.
    xxx. un_gini_2019: A UN table of the gini indexes of every country in 2019.

*** COMPETING HYPOTHESES ***
    1. Objective inequality best predicts perceived inequality across countries.
    2. Left-leaning ideology best predicts perceived inequality across countries.
    3. Undeserved pay best predicts perceptions of inequality.

*** BAYES PRIORI ***
The prior probability of each hypothesis predicting perceived inequality.

*** VARIABLES ***
Dependent Variable
    DV. perceivedinequality: The perceived inequality variable is recoded from v48. Only response 8 "Can't Choose"
    was removed, otherwise the variable was left the same as categorical.

Focal Independent Variables
    IV 1. left: Support for left-wing party was recoded from the PARTY_LR variable.
    IV 2. gini: The GINI index for every country, taken from the UN. The GINI values are imported from another dataset
    and added to the social inequality set.
    IV 3. undeservedpay: The deserve pay variable is recoded from V312. Responses 1 "Much less than I deserve" and 2
    "Less than I deserve" are kept as 1 and 2. Response 3 "What I deserve" is kept neutral as 0. Responses 4
    "More than I deserve" and 5 "Much more than I deserve" are coded as -2 and -1. Responses 6 "Never Worked" and
    "Can't Choose" were removed.

Controls
    C1. age: AGE
    C2. sex: SEX
    C3. pincome:
    C4. education: EDUCYRS
    C5. sss: Subjective Social Status (sss)
    C6. mode: Mode of survey, MODE.
    C7. country: country_code

*** PLAN OF ANALYSIS ***
Ordinal logistic regression. Certainly! Here's a summary of the provided R code suitable for a README file:
This script performs ordinal logistic regression analysis on a dataset to study the factors influencing perceptions of inequality.
Key features of the analysis include data preparation, model fitting, sensitivity analyses, and data visualization.
Libraries Used:
                             - `MASS`: For performing ordinal logistic regression (function `polr`).
                             - `haven`, `readr`, `tidyr`: For data manipulation and reading.
                             - `broom`: For tidying up model outputs.
                             - `knitr`: For data display and tabulation.
                             - `stargazer`: For creating well-formatted regression tables.
                             - `ggplot2`: For data visualization.
Data Preparation
                             - The dataset is read into R (assumed to be pre-loaded).
                             - NA values are dropped from the relevant variables.
                             - A new variable `opposed` is created based on conditions involving `execrlc` and `left`.
                             - The `perceivedinequality` and `age` variables are converted to the appropriate formats (factor and numeric, respectively).

Model Fitting
                             - Four ordinal logistic regression models (`model_gini`, `model_left`, `model_opposed`, `model_combined`) are fitted to examine the effects of different predictors on perceived inequality.
                             - The predictors include demographic and socioeconomic factors like `gini`, `age`, `sex`, `education`, `sss` (subjective social status), and `survey_mode`.

Sensitivity Analyses
                             - Interaction models are created to explore the combined effects of variables (`gini` and `age`, `left` and `opposed`).
                             - Simplified models are also fitted by excluding certain variables.

Output and Visualization
                             - Regression results are tabulated using `stargazer` and saved as a text file.
                             - A bar plot is created to visualize the average perceived inequality by country, showcasing the mean scores for each country.
