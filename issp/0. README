Welcome to my final write-up!

*** RQ ***
The basic motivation of my project is to investigate whether objective inequality (measured by the GINI coefficient),
left-leaning ideology, or perception that one is under-rewarded or over-rewarded better predicts perceptions
of inequality.

*** PROJECT PIECES ***
The project has five relevant components:
    1. pre-registration_research_protocol: A short write-up of my analysis plan, dataset, and hypotheses.
    2. issp_inequality_codebook: The code book for the data.
    3. final_paper: The final write-up.
    x. issp_analysis: The R code that used to conduct my analyses.
    xx. issp_inequality_2019: The STATA file of the 1999 ISSP module data.
    xxx. un_gini_2019: A UN table of the gini indexes of every country in 2019.

*** COMPETING HYPOTHESES ***
    1. Objective inequality best predicts perceived inequality across countries.
    2. Left-leaning ideology best predicts perceived inequality across countries.
    3. Undeserved pay best predicts perceptions of inequality.

*** BAYES PRIORI ***
The prior probability of each hypothesis predicting perceived inequality.

*** VARIABLES ***
Dependent Variable
    DV. perceivedinequality: The perceived inequality variable is recoded from v48. Only response 8 "Can't Choose"
    was removed, otherwise the variable was left the same as categorical.

Focal Independent Variables
    IV 1. left: Support for left-wing party was recoded from the PARTY_LR variable.
    IV 2. gini: The GINI index for every country, taken from the UN. The GINI values are imported from another dataset
    and added to the social inequality set.
    IV 3. deservepay: The deserve pay variable is recoded from V312. Responses 1 "Much less than I deserve" and 2
    "Less than I deserve" are kept as 1 and 2. Response 3 "What I deserve" is kept neutral as 0. Responses 4
    "More than I deserve" and 5 "Much more than I deserve" are coded as -2 and -1. Responses 6 "Never Worked" and
    "Can't Choose" were removed.

Controls
    C1. age: AGE
    C2. sex: SEX
    C3. education: EDUCYRS
    C4. sss: Subjective Social Status (sss)
    C5. urban_vs_rural: recoded from URBRURAL
    C6. country: recoded from country.
    C7. mode: Mode of survey, MODE.

*** PLAN OF ANALYSIS ***
Ordinal logistic regression. 

*** REPORTING ***
The paper will report the bayes factors for each model.
