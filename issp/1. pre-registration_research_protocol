RESEARCH QUESTION
What best predicts perceptions of inequality, a high GINI index, voting for a left-leaning party, or perception of
personally unjust rewards?

Stated as three hypotheses.
    (1) A high GINI index has the highest probability of predicting perceptions of inequality;
    (2) Voting for a left-leaning party has the highest probability of predicting perceptions of inequality;
    (3) Perception of personally unjust rewards has the highest probability of predicting perceptions of inequality.

DATA
All materials and analyses for this pre-registered study can be accessed through the public github account:
https://github.com/AlexanderTheAlright/git/tree/main/issp. The data for this study is taken from the 2019
“Inequality Module” of the International Social Survey Programme (N = 44,975) and the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators. The International Social Survey Programme is a cross-national collaboration of annual cross-sectional
surveys from all over the world. The “Inequality Module” is one of their sections that is specifically focused on
individual perceptions of inequality. The goal of the sample is to achieve a representative sample of the national
population 18 years or older. The sampling procedure used is a multistage simple random probability sample collects
data through a combination of web-based surveys, telephone, and face-to-face interviews. The ISSP is the largest
international investigation of perceptions of inequality, making it ideal for navigating competing hypotheses driving
perceptions of inequality. The World Development Indicators is a collection of national, regional, and global estimates
for various indicators of economic and social development. It was added as a supplementary component of the data since
the inequality module did not include GINI indexes.
    The focal variables are four: (DV) perceivedinequality; (IV1) gini; (IV2) left; (IV3) undeservedpay.
 They are combined with seven controls. To ensure that my open code can be read easily, I will refer to these variables
 as they have been coded. Any missing data will be dealt with through listwise deletion.
    perceivedinequality. The ordinal variable, perceived inequality, is recoded from their “type of society” question,
v48. The type of society question provides five pictorial representations of the distribution of wealth in one’s
society before asking the respondents to select which society represents their own.
TYPE A, “A society with few elite and a mass at the bottom,” represents the most inequality, whereas TYPE D and E
represent the least (the largest middle class). These response choices were coded from TYPE A = 4, TYPE B = 3,
TYPE C = 2, TYPE D = 1, and TYPE E = 0.
	gini. The GINI index value will be treated as a continuous variable out of 100. The gini value will be appended to
the existing ISSP dataset by country. The GINI coefficient is a measure of inequality ranging from 0, perfect
inequality, to 1 perfect equality. It is measured by calculating the absolute differences between the incomes of all
pairs of individuals in a population.
	left. Support for left-wing party will be recoded from the PARTY_LR variable. The ISSP’s PARTY_LR variable
classifies the vote of the respondent in the last election on a unified ‘left’ and ‘right’ scale. This variable was
recoded as dummy variable, 1 = left-wing party and 0 = neutral or right-wing party.
    undeservedpay. The undeserved pay variable will be recoded from v312 as a categorical variable.
Responses 1 "Much less than I deserve" and 2 "Less than I deserve" are kept as 1 and 2. Response 3 "What I deserve" is
kept neutral as 0. Responses 4 "More than I deserve" and 5 "Much more than I deserve" are coded as -2 and -1.
Responses 6 "Never Worked" and "Can't Choose" were removed. Category 0 is used as the reference category for all the
other responses.
controls. Seven controls known to effect perceived inequality were used in ascending analyses. Age, sex, education,
subjective social status (SSS), and mode of survey. Age was treated as a continuous variable, from 18 onwards. Sex was
treated as a binary, female = 1 and male = 0. Education was measured in terms of years from EDUCYRS and was treated as
continuous in analysis. Education and leftism have been known to be associated, which would therefore confound the full
effect if not controlled for. Income is also included since higher income tends to be associated with perceptions of
inequality. Subjective social status measures an individual’s sense of where they are relative “to those with the best
jobs, highest incomes, and best educations” on a scale from 1 to 10. It was included because subjective social status
can confound the effect of undeservedpay, as the actual impact of undeservedpay may be due to low status position and
low income. Subjective social status was treated as a continuous variable. Perceived inequality can sometimes be
affected by the social desirability, potentially meaning that in-person surveys will lead to lower reports of perceived
inequality; as a consequence, survey mode will be treated as a categorical “online,” “in-person,” and “telephone.”

PLAN OF ANALYSIS
To adjudicate the three hypotheses, my study conducts four ordinal logistic regression models and compares their bayes
factors. Ordinal logistic regression is used because the dependent variable is ordinal and categorical, perceived
inequality ranging from most equal (type D) to most inequal (type A). The bayes factors are used because they are
crucial in integrating prior probability of expecting each of the predictors with the posteriori evidence to establish
meaningful levels of significance. Given the evidence supporting each independent variable as a predictor of perceived
inequality, I have chosen to set a normal distribution prior and a standard deviation of two.
1.	Model one, gini: perceivedinequality – gini + age + sex + education + sss + survey_mode
2.	Model two, lefty: perceivedinequality – lefty: age + sex + education + sss + survey_mode
3.	Model three, undeserved pay: perceivedinequality – undeservedpay + age + sex + education + sss + survey_mode
4.	Model four, combined: perceivedinequality – gini + left + undeservedpay + age + sex + education + sss + survey_mode
These four basic models will be interpreted in light of their bayes factors, where the highest score will
suggest the model that best explains variation in perceived inequality. After the initial analyses, which will be
presented no matter what, sensitivity analyses will also be conducted using different priors and combinations of the
controls. Results based on different priors and different controls might also be presented if they contribute
significantly different answers.
